# The Chaotic Covenant Code of Misconduct

*(aka: A Mostly-Useless Guide to Contributing Without Caring Too Much)*

## Our Pledge (Sort of)

In the spirit of fostering a wild, unpredictable environment, we as contributors and mischief-makers pledge to making participation in our project a delightful mess for everyone. Age, size, nationality, personal appearance, religion, or astrological sign‚Äînone of it matters. Chaos accepts all.

## Our Anti-Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a **gloriously unhinged** environment include:

* Using ironic or chaotic language (bonus points for memes and ASCII art)
* Arguing passionately, then forgetting what the argument was about
* Responding to constructive criticism with GIFs, sarcasm, or interpretive dance
* Focusing on what is funniest for the moment, not necessarily what is best for the community
* Showing empathy in bizarre ways, like sending someone pizza at 3AM

Examples of **perfectly acceptable** behavior by participants include (and sometimes expected call-and-response rituals like when someone says 'boop' the other must reply 'lizard ü¶é'):

* Excessive trolling, provided it‚Äôs hilarious
* Using way too many emojis üéâüî•üíÄüçï
* Publishing your own private information just to confuse people
* Publicly declaring vendettas against tabs, spaces, or YAML
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a *professional* setting, but this isn‚Äôt professional, so it‚Äôs fine

## Our Responsibilities (or Lack Thereof)

Project maintainers are responsible for stirring the pot. They have the right (and moral obligation) to:

* Edit your commits into haikus
* Replace your code with ASCII ducks
* Reject pull requests because Mercury is in retrograde
* Ban contributors temporarily, permanently, or just until they say sorry in all caps

## Scope (Everywhere, Always)

This Code of Misconduct applies within project spaces, public spaces, and dream sequences. Examples include:

* Using an official project e-mail (that may or may not exist ‚Äî spoiler: it doesn‚Äôt)
* Posting via a social media account nobody follows (and probably doesn‚Äôt exist either)
* Acting as an appointed representative at anarchist potlucks or LAN parties

## Enforcement (Chaotic Neutral)

Instances of *boring, overly polite, or otherwise acceptable* behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via smoke signal, carrier pigeon, or aggressive karaoke (bonus points for Agretsuko references). All complaints will be reviewed, ignored, or mocked according to the vibe of the day.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Misconduct may face repercussions such as:

* Being roasted in the README
* Losing their admin rights to a rubber chicken
* Having their commits randomly reverted at 3AM
* Getting swatted by a team of cop gigolos at dinner time
