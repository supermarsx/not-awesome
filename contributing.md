# Contribution Guidelines (Not-Awesome Edition)

Please note that this project is released with a [Chaotic Code of Misconduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its chaos.

## Adding a not-awesome list

There are no rules here. Spin a wheel, consult a magic 8-ball, ask your cat, or just copy-paste random text from Wikipedia. Forget about strict guidelines—those are for awesome people. Just open a pull request, drop in whatever nonsense you feel like (shopping lists, dream journals, ASCII potato art). Conflicting duplicates? Pure gold. The less sense it makes, the more not-awesome it becomes.

## Creating your own not-awesome list

To create your own half-baked list, check out the [instructions](create-list.md). Or don’t. It’s not mandatory, and we won’t notice either way.

## Adding something to a not-awesome list

If you have something *not-awesome* to contribute, here’s how:

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (sorry about that part).

1. Access the not-awesome list’s GitHub page. For example: [https://github.com/supermarsx/not-awesome](https://github.com/supermarsx/not-awesome)
2. Click on the `readme.md` file. Or any file, really. We don’t care.
3. Click on the edit icon and type something, anything. Bonus points if it breaks Markdown.
4. Say why you’re proposing the changes (or just type ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯).
5. Click on "Propose file change" and let the maintainers sort it out.
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and celebrate your contribution to mediocrity.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer might ask you to change your Pull Request. Ignore them if you want—it’s not like we’re enforcing quality here. But if you’re feeling generous:

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write-up on how to change a Pull Request. Or just close it and open a new one, creating even more chaos.
