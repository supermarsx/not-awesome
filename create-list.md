# Creating Your Own Not-Awesome List

1. Ignore the Not Awesome manifesto and list guidelines. Weâ€™re here to be messy and proudly non-compliant.
2. Donâ€™t bother searching this list before making a new one. If thereâ€™s a duplicate, let chaos reignâ€”multiple bad versions are better than one polished list.
3. You might find a Yeoman generator useful. We don't have one thatâ€™s the point.
4. Submit your list immediately. Or after 30 minutes. Or never. Time is an illusion.
5. Donâ€™t re-read any guidelines before submitting a pull request. If you somehow end up here, congratulations on failing upwards.

Thanks for being not-awesome! ðŸ™ƒ May your lists be pointless, your links be broken, and your readers wonder why they wasted their time.
