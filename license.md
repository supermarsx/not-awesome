# YOLO License 1.0

LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This is not legal advice. This is not even good advice. Distribution of this document does not create an attorney-client relationship. Use of this license may result in laughter, confusion, or catastrophic consequences. Proceed at your own risk.

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions automatically give creators exclusive rights over their works. The YOLO License exists so creators can shout “You Only Live Once!” and throw those rights into the nearest dumpster fire. The point is to let anyone do anything with the work—reuse, remix, redistribute, resell, rebrand, or regret.

Creators using this license are effectively saying: *“I don’t care. Take it, break it, make it yours, or meme it to death.”*

## Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Affirmer (aka the poor soul who applied this license) irrevocably waives, abandons, and surrenders all claims, copyrights, related rights, moral rights, bragging rights, or future royalties in connection with the Work. This waiver applies worldwide, across all mediums, dimensions, timelines, and alternate realities.

## Fallback

If, for some reason, a court decides the YOLO waiver doesn’t hold, then the Affirmer grants everyone a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, irrevocable license to do literally anything with the Work. Yes, anything. Even that. Don’t ask.

## Limitations and Disclaimers

1. No trademark, patent, or cosmic soul-binding rights are affected by this license.
2. The Work is provided “AS IS,” with no warranties of quality, taste, or usefulness. It might work. It might not. It might summon demons.
3. The Affirmer is not responsible for obtaining permissions from anyone else, including ex-partners, overlords, or your cat.
4. The Affirmer understands and acknowledges that YOLO Commons is not a party to this document and has no obligations whatsoever. They probably don’t even exist.

**In short: Do whatever. Live with the consequences. YOLO.**
