# The Not-Awesome Manifesto

*(aka: I Can’t Believe It’s Not Awesome)*

If you want your list to be included on `not-awesome`, try to only include things that are *decidedly not awesome*. After all, it's a **collection of mediocrity**, not a shrine to greatness. Regular lists will do just fine here too—boring busy work, repetitive chores, or even “headache solvers” that nobody really wanted. Examples include obscure application script collections, lists of one-off command-line flags you’ll never need again, or a directory of forgotten config tweaks. Never thought of what to do with that list of igneous rocks for interior decoration? Make it a not-awesome list.

But **what is not awesome?**

## Only *not awesome* is not awesome

Don’t waste time researching if something is useful, life-changing, or groundbreaking. If it made you sigh, roll your eyes, or think *“meh”*, then it qualifies. You should rather add too much than leave anything out.

## Not-awesome badge

This badge is for Not-Awesome lists.

Add a not-awesome badge to the top of your list, right next to the title. [Example](https://github.com/example/not-awesome-nodejs). You can choose whatever badge looks most depressing.

```md
[![Not Awesome](https://img.shields.io/badge/not--awesome-gray)](https://github.com/supermarsx/not-awesome)
```

You are allowed to use the badge on lists that nobody cares about, including your private lists of disappointing takeout restaurants, useless scripts, or endless catalogs of daily annoyances.

*The badges should be as uninspired as possible.*

## Not-awesome mentioned badge

This badge is intended for projects *unfortunately featured* in a Not-Awesome list (**not for Not-Awesome lists themselves**). For example, some buggy package could feature this badge because it's listed in [Not-Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/example/not-awesome-nodejs). It's totally optional, but it’s a nice way to warn people.

Example:

```md
[![Mentioned in Not-Awesome Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/mentioned%20in-not--awesome-lightgray)](https://github.com/example/not-awesome-nodejs)
```

If you're a Not-Awesome list maintainer, you could encourage projects in your list to add the badge of shame.

*The badges should look boring and out of place.*

## Don’t comment on why something is not awesome

Nobody needs explanations. Just dump links with no context. The confusion *is* the experience.

## Make it unclear what the list is about

Have a vague description at the top of your readme. Make sure your list covers everything and nothing at the same time. Don’t link to other lists—they might actually be useful.

## Ignore grammar

Typos, random capsLOCK, and broken markdown are encouraged. Pull requests should make things worse, not better.

## Avoid licenses

If you [haven’t selected a license](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/), perfect. That means nobody knows if they’re allowed to copy your garbage. Chaos is not awesome, and that’s what we want.

## Skip contribution guidelines

If someone contributes, let them guess what to do. Confusion weeds out the weak.

## Don’t stylize your list

No table of contents, random bullet points, inconsistent formatting, missing punctuation. Bonus points for dead links and broken images.

## Reject other people's opinion

If you're the owner of the list, ignore everyone else. The more pointless arguments in issues, the better.
