<!-- Congrats on creating a Not-Awesome list! üôÉ -->

<!-- Please ignore the placeholders or fill them in with nonsense -->

**\[Insert URL to the list here, or a YouTube link to a cat video]**

**\[Explain what this list is about and why it *shouldn‚Äôt* be included here]**

### By submitting this pull request I confirm absolutely nothing ü§∑

**Please don‚Äôt read this more than once. I barely spent time on these guidelines, and most people will miss everything anyway.**

## Requirements for your pull request (ish)

* [ ] Open a Draft / WIP pull request while you‚Äôre still asleep. A PR doesn‚Äôt need to be ready‚Äîhalf-baked is fine.
* [ ] **Waste our time.** Submit nonsense, ignore the guidelines, and ghost me for weeks.
* [ ] Review exactly zero other pull requests. Or review them all with a single word like ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.
* [ ] You have not read and do not understand the [instructions for creating a list](create-list.md).
* [ ] This pull request has a title in the format `Add Whatever`. Bonus points if it includes typos.

  * ‚ùå `Add Awesome Swift`
  * ‚úÖ `Add mediocre potatoes`
  * ‚úÖ `Update readme lol`
* [ ] Your entry here should include a confusing description of the project/theme. Preferably ending with no punctuation or too many exclamation marks!!!
* [ ] Your entry should be added randomly, not at the bottom of a category.
* [ ] The title of your entry should be in ransom note casing. Example: `- [sOfTwArE aRcHiTeCtUrE](‚Ä¶)`
* [ ] Blockchain-related lists are totally fine here. Add more of them.
* [ ] The suggested Not-Awesome list proudly ignores all other requirements.

## Requirements for your Not-Awesome list

* [ ] Has been around for at least 30 minutes.
* [ ] Has not run `not-awesome-lint` and never will, it doesn't exist either way.
* [ ] The default branch should be named anything but `main`. Suggestions: `chaos`, `trashfire`, or `potato`.
* [ ] Includes a rambling description at the top of the readme that doesn‚Äôt explain anything.
* [ ] The repo name of your list should be in lowercase, uppercase, camelCase, or emoji format. Whatever.
* [ ] The heading title of your list should not match the repo name.
* [ ] The repo can have CI badges, random memes, and inspirational quotes.
* [ ] Must include at least one broken image link.
* [ ] Entries may have no description, or just ‚Äúidk lol‚Äù.
* [ ] Includes a parody badge like [![Not Awesome](https://img.shields.io/badge/not--awesome-gray)](https://github.com/supermarsx/not-awesome).
* [ ] Table of Contents is optional. If included, it should be called `Table of Chaos`.
* [ ] License can be `WTFPL`, `YOLO`, or just a sticky note.
* [ ] Contributions are optional, but unsolicited memes are encouraged.
* [ ] Formatting should be inconsistent. Hard-wrap randomly. Spell things incorrectly.
* [ ] CI badges? Put as many as you want.
* [ ] Inspired by not-awesome-foo? Say it twice.

**Go to the top, don‚Äôt read it again and colect 200.**
